        <dl class="message-properties">
            <dt>payload
                <span class="property-type">obejct</span>

            <dd>The events / status messages received from the vacuum cleaning
                robot</dd>
        </dl>

    <h3>Details</h3>
        <p><code>msg.payload</code> can be chosen from a list of available
        commands, which are provided by the underlying library.
        Depending on the model of the vacuum cleaning robot, not all commands
        are fully supported.</p>
        <p>Depending on the command used, additional parameters need to be
        passed.</p>
        <p>This has to be done by the use of <code>msg.arg</code>,
        <code>msg.arg2</code> as well as <code>msg.arg3</code>.</p>
        <p>An overview of the existing commands as well as their required
        parameters can be found in the wiki of the underlying library, which is
        listed under references below.</p>
        <p>For easier use, the
        <span style="background-color:Gainsboro">deebot-command</span>-node
        should be used, which provides an interface for the selection of
        available commands as well as the input of required parameters.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: The inputs are not passed to the output!</p>
